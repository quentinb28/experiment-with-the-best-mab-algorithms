## 2. Background

A business is about the continuous improvement of its products, services and processes. If they are to survive in today's fast-paced environment, businesses have to adopt a lean mentality-fail fast and learn quickly.

I really invite you to have a go at my blog post [HERE](https://medium.com/p/6474af8124da/edit).
